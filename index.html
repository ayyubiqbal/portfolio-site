            <h2>Become a cat lover</h2>
            <p>The cat (Felis catus) is a domestic species of small carnivorous mammal. It is the only domesticated
                species in the family Felidae and is often referred to as the domestic cat to distinguish it from the
                wild members of the family. A cat can either be a house cat, a farm cat or a feral cat; the latter
                ranges freely and avoids human contact. Domestic cats are valued by humans for companionship and their
                ability to hunt rodents.</p>
